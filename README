# Kalah AI

C++ implementation of an AI agent for the game **Kalah (Mancala)**.  
It uses the **Minimax algorithm** with **alpha–beta pruning** and **heuristic move ordering**.  
This agent won **1st place out of 200 participants** in the **2024 AI Agent Tournament in Erlangen**.

## Overview
The goal was to build a fast, competitive Kalah AI that could handle deep search efficiently.
All agents were then paired against each other in a knockout-style tournament.

## Main features
- Minimax search with alpha–beta pruning  
- Move ordering for faster pruning  
- Custom heuristic evaluation function  
- Profiling-based performance improvements
